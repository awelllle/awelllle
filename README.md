âš¡ I'm a software engineer that creatively solves problems. I'm a big fan of breaking down complex tech terms so that it becomes easily understood. This is why I started my personal [blog](https://uncomplex.io). I'm all about postively impacting people around me.

When I'm not coding, I'm strengthening existing connections with friends, forging new ones and exploring my many fascinations.
